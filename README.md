# PlayAware

PlayAware automatically adjusts video playback speed when you switch tabs or windows - faster when you're watching, slower when you're not.

## Detailed Description:
PlayAware makes watching videos more efficient by intelligently controlling playback speed based on your attention. When you're actively watching videos, it plays them at your preferred faster speed. When you switch to another tab or window, it automatically slows down the video so you don't miss important content.

2. Easy toggle on/off with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Y or Cmd+Shift+Y)
3. Add specific domains where the extension should work
4. Quick access to settings via toolbar button
5. Visual indicators when toggling extension state
   
Perfect for educational videos, tutorials, webinars, and streaming content.
